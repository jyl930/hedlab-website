                 data-authors="Juyoung Lee, Hyerim Koo, Namkyu Park, Yeonsook Hwang"
                 data-abstract="The rapid growth of e-commerce has significantly increased daily logistics operations, shifting consumer habits from traditional offline shopping to online systems that enable convenient delivery to preferred locations. To address these demands, logistics centers have evolved from simple storage facilities into multifunctional hubs that handle receiving, storing, sorting, and shipping. This transformation has drawn attention to the sustainability and working environments of these facilities, leading to the introduction of WELL certification, which emphasizes human-centered design to support users' physical and mental health. Among its ten core concepts, the ‘Movement’ category is particularly important for promoting efficient and safe circulation. However, research on its practical application remains limited. This study addresses the gap in research by analyzing the application of the WELL ‘Movement’ in logistics center design, using the ESR Kendall Square Bucheon Logistics Park as a case study. By examining the design strategies employed in this facility, the research aims to propose actionable guidelines for creating efficient and human-centered logistics environments. This study also seeks to encourage broader adoption of WELL in South Korea, where certified projects are still rare. The data collecting process for this study involved three main stages. Initially, prior research was analyzed to identify key factors influencing circulation design and the spatial zoning of logistics centers. This informed the development of interview questions targeting specific design elements, such as the separation of pedestrian and vehicle pathways and strategies for optimizing movement efficiency. In-depth interviews with design experts provided comprehensive insights into these aspects. Finally, text analysis methods, including Term Frequency (TF), TF-IDF, and LDA Topic Modeling, were applied to the interview data. This approach enabled the extraction of key topics and the development of tailored recommendations for improving circulation systems and spatial design in logistics centers. The analysis proposed improvements to existing certification criteria to better address the unique requirements of logistics centers. For circulation design, safety-focused enhancements were suggested, including the incorporation of clear pedestrian and vehicle separation, floor-specific color coding for visibility, and compliant evacuation routes with fireproof elevators for emergencies. In site planning, recommendations included proximity to interchanges for improved logistics flow, adequate parking capacity for workers, and one-way traffic systems to reduce congestion. Additionally, a new beta section, 'Enhanced Working Environment', was developed to address gaps in current standards. This section emphasizes efficient space zoning, safe movement pathways, and diverse support facilities to enhance operational safety and efficiency in logistics centers. This study identified key limitations in existing certification criteria for specialized facilities and proposed three strategies for improvement. These include enhancing circulation design for safety and efficiency, refining site planning for traffic flow and worker accessibility, and introducing criteria for support facilities unique to logistics centers. The findings highlight the need for certification frameworks to address specialized environments beyond general office spaces. Additionally, this study underscores that prioritizing occupant safety is essential to well-being design. It recommends that systems like WELL focus on safety elements as a foundation before considering aesthetics to ensure user well-being.">

                 data-authors="Ting Liu, Yujin Kim, Yeonsook Hwang"
                 data-abstract="Recently, museums have been transforming into multifunctional publicspaces that not only focus on artifact preservation, research, andexhibition but also enhance visitor experiences and strengthenconnections with local communities. Exhibition that conveys historical,artistic, and cultural value refl ect a “visitor-centered” exhibitionconcept aimed at fostering interaction with the audience. Through this,it enhances visitors’ satisfaction by diversifying exhibition content andexpanding audience participation. Therefore, this study aims toanalyze national public museums in Seoul from the perspective ofmuseum exhibition elements. Based on previous research, themuseum exhibition elements for visitor-centered exhibition werereorganized into “Exhibition Space, Exhibition Media, and VisitorOperation,” and a checklist was derived from the detailed content.Using this framework, a fi eld study was conducted focusing on fi venational public museums located in Seoul that have been openedsince the 2000s. The study found that, in terms of exhibition spaces, an open spatialstructure was implemented to consider visitors’ spatial perception andmovement paths. However, the improper placement of exhibits andrelated technical equipment, as well as spatial structures with multiplelevels or numerous entrances, were identifi ed as obstacles to visitorconvenience. It is necessary to refi ne the guidance system to facilitateeasier understanding and navigation for visitors. Exhibition mediautilized advanced technologies such as LCD panels, HMD technology,and holograms, along with audio media like sound eff ects andnarration, to enhance information delivery. However, issues ofdiminished user experience due to certain technical defects wereobserved. Given that museums are adopting digital technologies todiversify exhibition content, it is essential to minimize technical defectsthrough regular maintenance and management. In terms of visitor operation, the museums allowed unrestricted viewing without time constraints and offered a variety of experiential programs tailored to the specific needs of visitors. However, in the case of exhibits requiring longer times, surges in visitor numbers led to congestion and waiting times. To address this, it is necessary to introduce a reservation-based system to distribute visitor demand and strengthen on-site management and guidance systems to enhance viewing efficiency. To achieve “visitor-centered” exhibition based on museum exhibition elements, it is essential to establish systematic feedback, such as surveys and online evaluations. Additionally, the development of a personalized guide system using AI and big data technologies should be considered to offer tailored visitor routes. Future research could yield more meaningful results by exploring the correlation between these museum exhibition elements and visitor satisfaction.">

                 data-authors="Youlim Hwang, Heasoo Ryu, Hojun Ryoo, Namkyu Park, Yeonsook Hwang"
                 data-abstract="The WELL Platinum Certification is the highest level of certification developed by the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI), and to achieve this, it is important to provide an environment that positively affects the physical and mental health of employees in addition to the environmentally friendly elements of space. The case study focuses on the offices of JLL Korea, a global real estate and investment management company that became the first South Korean to receive WELL Platinum certification in 2021. The purpose of this study is to analyze how WELL certification was applied to real office spaces, and to highlight the impact on the health of individuals, organizations, and society. To this end, a checklist based on the WELL standard was developed, and employee interviews and site observations were conducted. The results of this study are as follows. First, the WELL-certified JLL office space has improved personal health and work efficiency. It maintains visual comfort and energy management with blinds and UV films optimized for natural lighting, reducing the physical burden and providing a comfortable working environment with an air quality management system and height-adjustable furniture. Focus rooms and soundproof phone booths ensure privacy and increase work engagement, and the open kitchen in the lobby supports employee health by offering seasonal fruits and low-sugar snacks. This design enhances health and work efficiency, setting a new direction for employee-friendly office spaces. Second, the WELL-certified JLL office space promoted communication and collaboration within the organization. The open office layout and activity-based working system break down departmental boundaries, encouraging natural interactions and strengthening bonds. This environment promotes collaboration between teams and increases project efficiency by sharing different ideas. It also played an important role in creating an open and creative organizational culture while improving collaboration skills. Third, the WELL-certified JLL office space effectively established sustainability. In the WELL certification process, the initial cost burden and the need for maintenance were major challenges, but the space continues to be operated with a focus on improving utilization and employee satisfaction. This demonstrates that WELL certification is not merely a one-time project but rather represents a long-term, sustainability-based management system. This case study explores the impact on individuals, organizations, and society how WELL certification can be combined with healthy office design and long-term sustainability. Wellness-focused designs such as air quality, natural lighting, and ergonomic furniture in the office space have helped to improve the physical and mental health of individuals as well as increase work immersion and efficiency. At the organizational level, spaces such as open spaces and focus rooms played an important role in promoting collaboration and communication and building a creative and productive organizational culture. Socially, sustainable design and well-being oriented approach have enabled the realization of corporate social responsibility (CSR), setting new standards for emphasizing health and sustainability, and enabling co-prosperity of companies and society. These results are significant in that the WELL certification can be used as a strategic tool to achieve health and sustainability in an integrated manner, beyond simple architectural certification.">

                 data-authors="Yujin Kim, Yeonsook Hwang"
                 data-abstract="In South Korea, the ongoing low birth rate has led to a decrease in the school-age population and the underutilization of school facilities and land, emerging as a social issue. In response to this phenomenon, the Ministry of Education has implemented improvements in the education system, including the 'Flexible operation of education in regions and schools.' This aims to repurpose school facilities beyond their traditional role as educational spaces, transforming them into multipurpose spaces for community use. School facilities are increasingly regarded as resources that promote regional revitalization from both geographical and emotional perspectives. Consequently, the scope of utilizing these facilities as public spaces for local communities is expanding, enabling the creation of customized public spaces that align with the characteristics and conditions of each community. Therefore, this study aims to analyze cases of public spaces utilizing Korean school facilities and propose directions for their improvement and development as accessible public spaces that can be used not only by students but also by residents. Through a literature review, a checklist based on public space components of school facility utilization was derived based on types of school facility utilization and related guidelines. Based on this, field research was conducted focusing on cultural, educational, and community-centered spaces utilizing school facilities in Korea, primarily those developed after the 2020s. As a result, it was commonly observed that public spaces utilizing school facilities in Korea provide community activities focused on lifelong education programs for residents, in addition to being linked to school education. Through this, the physical environments of currently operating school facilities and closed school facilities are utilized to assign new functions and values as public spaces through new construction or remodeling. Additionally, these spaces often reinforce local identity by hosting exhibitions or events that reflect regional characteristics. In addition, school facilities are generally located in densely residential areas, making space utilization easier. In some cases, institutions operated by local governments also moved into the space, showing that various public infrastructure was provided to local residents. As the potential for utilizing school facilities as multifunctional public spaces based on connections with the local community becomes more apparent, there is a need to consider the establishment of more detailed guidelines. For this purpose, future research could yield more meaningful results by conducting surveys and interviews to assess the satisfaction of residents.">

Amenity does not meansimple convenience facilities or specific facilities, but a comprehensive livingenvironment that integrates harmony, comfort, and beauty with the surroundingenvironment. Space regeneration using amenities provides a friendly and comfortableenvironment for people to enjoy, and promotes new urban cultural experiences. The purpose of this study is to analyze cultural spaces using urban regeneration inSeoul from the perspective of amenities and to suggest ways to revitalize culturalspaces. To analyze the urban regeneration culture space from the perspective ofamenity, an analysis framework was based on the characteristics of environment,aesthetics, convenience, and culture. An on-site survey was conducted by seven casestudies that were reopened as urban regeneration spaces belonging to the SeoulCultural Foundation. The results of this study are as follows. First, from the perspective of amenity, it can beclassified into environmental, aesthetic, convenient, and cultural characteristics of urbanregeneration culture spaces. Environmental characteristic provides people with a senseof comfort and psychological stability by providing a nature-friendly environment andminimizing costs and environmental pollution. Aesthetic characteristic provides thecomfort of facilities such as natural landscapes and public sculptures in harmony withspace. Convenient characteristic provides easily accessible to users by forming anonline network that can quickly obtain a diversity of information and publictransportation. Cultural characteristic promotes convergence and cooperation of localcommunities by user's participation in cultural activities and education. Second, urbanregeneration culture spaces are composed of exhibition, creation, education, rest, sales,and community spaces. Third, among the characteristics of urban regeneration culture,aesthetic characteristic was the best and environmental characteristic was the mostinsufficient. In order to promote amenities, the environment that can provide userswith not only comfort, but also various possibilities are needed by creating acommunity and a rest area that emphasizes eco-friendly landscaping. For a sustainable environment of cultural spaces, efforts are needed to improve thecomfort of urban regeneration cultural spaces by cooperating with many citizens andartists to develop shared programs and spaces.">

Although the closedschool has lost its educational function, it is considered an important resource forpromoting regional revitalization from a geographical and emotional perspective. Inthis respect, it is closely related to placemaking that improves the quality of life of localresidents through the values and culture unique to the community based on a people-centered approach. The purpose of this study is to derive planning elements ofplacemaking and analyze regeneration spaces utilizing closed school. Based onprevious research and the guidelines for the use of closed school, a checklist wasderived that reorganized planning elements of placemaking applicable to regenerationspace utilizing closed school. An on-site survey was conducted by eight case studiesthat were reopened as cultural and experiential education spaces located inmetropolitan cities in Korea. The results of this study are as follows. First, this study derived ‘Enhancement of Publicness’, ‘Forming a Bond’, ‘Utilization ofResources’, ‘Convenience of Access’, and ‘Image Formation’ as planning elements ofplacemaking. Second, the regeneration space utilizing closed school is created throughthe methods of ‘Remodeling’ and ‘New Construction’. Both remodeling and newconstruction methods preserve and utilize existing school, which are importantresources for the community, it is necessary to consider ways to directly or indirectlyexpress the preservation value of space. Accordingly, rather than simply organizing anexhibition space related to the historical elements of existing school, the space itself, inthe non-physical aspect of placemaking, provides a variety of experiences to usersthrough emotional connections such as ‘memories, experiences, and emotions’ relatedto the existing place. Third, applying the ‘Image formation’ element was the mostinsufficient. Regarding image formation, it is necessary to consider the reflection of adesign that visually expresses the new purpose of a closed school throughregeneration. Visual effects can be created by symbolic images in the main entranceand lobby space, where the most movement and inflow of users occurs. Fourth, inorder to enhance of publicness, the number of users should be limited throughreservations in consideration of congestion in experiential spaces, but otherconvenience spaces should be free of time restrictions so that local residents can usethem at any time. Regeneration spaces utilizing closed school should be used ascommunity spaces for local residents in both physical and emotional aspects by moreactively applying the elements of placemaking.">

However, it is often built at low design costs, so user satisfaction is low. In residential spaces, user satisfaction is very important as it directly relates to residents’ quality of life. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to identify satisfaction of shared house residents, in regard to their own personal space. An online survey was conducted on 316 single-person households, people in their 20s and 30s. The spatial elements of a shared house are composed of four elements: space composition, color and finishing materials, furniture arrangement, and indoor environment. These elements are further subdivided into sub-elements. Space composition includes the bedroom location and size, the convenience of access to the bedroom, and storage space, among others. Color and finishing materials include the colors and finishing materials of the closet, cabinet, walls and floors. Furniture arrangement includes bed and closet size, cabinet size, bed and closet type, and number of cabinets. Indoor environment includes lighting color and control, soundproofing condition, window size and location, ventilation and solar radiation. According to the user satisfaction evaluation, furniture arrangement was deemed to be most important among residents, followed by color and finishing materials, indoor environment, and space composition. According to user satisfaction with sub-elements, the convenience of access to the bedroom, the color of the closet, the size of the cabinet, and the soundproofing condition was low. To enhance housing satisfaction among single-person households and young individuals, it is necessary to improve the convenience of access to the bedroom, selecting an attractive closet color, checking the appropriate cabinet size, and soundproofing condition in the indoor environment. The elements of shared houses should be well planned to increase the satisfaction of both single-person households and young people.">

                 data-authors="Kyunghwa Han, Yeonsook Hwang"
                 data-abstract="The development of new technologies has coincided with the migration of consumption behavior online, following the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, companies urgently need to innovate their offline marketing strategies to attract consumers. One potential approach is through the regeneration and rebranding of old or underused spaces, using the addition of new design elements in a process known as 'space marketing' or 'upcycling'. The purpose of this study is to identify the characteristics of upcycling complex cultural space from a space marketing perspective and to analyze the potential of space design characteristics as a marketing strategy through case analysis. This paper examines the concepts of 'space marketing', the ‘upcycled space', and the 'complex cultural space' through a systematic review of the literature. The framework of analysis was derived by extracting the strategic elements of space marketing and the characteristics of upcycling complex cultural spaces. Field surveys were conducted on eight locations in Seongdong-gu, Seoul, which were selected for their high concentration of warehouses and other industrial. These cases are currently being used as complex cultural spaces through space upcycling. The past uses of these spaces include a printing factory, auto repair plant, printing shop, chemical plant, textile factory, metal welding factory, auto repair shop, and printing plant. To derive the characteristics of upcycled complex cultural spaces, we conducted a systematic review of 10 relevant studies published after 2017. We then linked these characteristics with Hong's (2007) spatial marketing strategic elements to analyze them from the perspective of space marketing. We selected economic feasibility, historicity, artistry, usefulness, and participation as the framework of analysis. The study yielded several key findings. Firstly, it was discovered that the entertainment-oriented type of upcycled spaces tend to have a more diverse spatial composition than the commercial-oriented type. Entertainment-oriented spaces not only focus on generating commercial profits but also on creating emotional connections with users through collaborations with other brands and planning future regeneration projects. Secondly, visitors were likely to take advantage of these spaces. By participating in programs and experiences offered in the space, visitors could gain a better understanding of the space's purpose. However, there were no specific programs created solely for upcycled complex cultural spaces. Thirdly, the study found that there were few design elements that used existing industrial waste products to create aesthetic value. If equipment from the old factory featured in the upcycled space was presented in a visually appealing way, the space could be more distinctive and desirable to visit. Finally, the development of upcycled spaces should move beyond the simple maintenance of existing spaces and focus on creating a cohesive narrative that connects the past with the brand's identity. By incorporating storytelling and eco-friendly elements, and linking environmental issues with upcycling, the upcycled space can be strategically marketed to create a differentiated aesthetic value that reflects the coexistence of the past and present, and this can help boost the local economy.">

                 data-title="Space Branding Characteristics of Future Heritage Building in Seoul"
                 data-authors="Sua Kim, Yeonsook Hwang"
                 data-abstract="The cultural heritage of Seoul is being damaged due to rapid social change. Accordingly, the city of Seoul established a comprehensive future heritage preservation plan to protect the disappearing cultural heritage and re-establish a cultural identity. Future heritage refers to cultural heritage that is worth handing down to future generations. Meanwhile, space branding expanded its scope beyond commercial spaces to the reinvigoration of a city’s image, emerging as an important element that shows the image and identity of a region. Currently, there is a lack of research on branding for the preservation and popularization of future heritage sites in Seoul, so research is needed on how to use space branding to best deliver differentiated and competitive future heritage sites. The purpose of this study is to analyze the future heritage of Seoul from a space branding perspective, in order to raise awareness of the importance of heritage such that it can be preserved for future generations. The scope of the study, eight Seoul-based cultural heritage case sites were analyzed through field surveys. This study contains a literature review and a case study. First, the concepts and roles of 'future heritage' and 'space branding' were investigated. Next, the characteristics of space branding and the role of Seoul's future heritage were established to derive a framework for analysis. Analysis items were analyzed by classifying them into historical, future-oriented, and social aspects. The results were as follows. First, in terms of history, traces of the past were displayed through the building structure, bricks, or stones, but there were cases in which historical information was not visually provided. In this case, it was necessary to express the unique identity by arranging the information of the historical background space on the media board, the information wall, the visual elements of the text board, and the symbols and monuments outside and inside. Second, in the future-oriented aspect, all case sites preserved the buildings through regeneration, but there were cases where no difference from other buildings was found, and some failed to use sustainable finishing materials. In order to solve this, a strategy to secure identity by using unique patterns and colors in design, using sustainable finishing materials, and otherwise increasing building differentiation were needed. Third, in terms of social aspect, the use rate was often low due to a lack of space for various experiences. To solve this problem, core spaces which stimulate emotion and promote a sense of openness must be provided, and these spaces must ensure increased accessibility to increase the use rate. This study presented the direction of regeneration of future heritage, and it is expected that the identity of Seoul's future heritage will be further established by continuously conducting research on space branding.">

                 data-title="Case Analysis of Dream Classroom Project for Elementary Schools in Korea"
                 data-authors="Yujin Kim, Yeonsook Hwang"
                 data-abstract="Recently, the Korean Ministry of Education announced a revised curriculum stressing the need for creative education. Accordingly, the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education is attempting to create an environment where creative education is possible through remodeling classrooms with a ‘Dreaming Classroom project’. Therefore, this study analyzed educational spaces for each grade of elementary school to improve the creative educational environment. Previous studies were used to redefine the characteristics of creative educational spaces, enabling analysis considering the characteristics of each grade. At this time, ‘autonomy, playfulness, comfort, connectivity, and diversity’ were used as a framework for spatial analysis based on the characteristics of creative educational spaces. This study focusses on elementary schools, where the ‘Dreaming Classroom project’ was applied to both lower and upper grade classrooms, and particularly zeroed in on classrooms and hallways. The analysis results are as follows. First, unlike the existing classrooms, creative educational classrooms with features such as interconnected hallways, foster learning through enhancing creative educational classroom constructs such as ‘connectivity’ and ‘diversity.’ Accordingly, it is necessary to install built-in furniture capable of storing teaching aids to facilitate the sorts of dynamic environments necessary for creative education. Second, the lower grades have characteristics of early childhood, play learning was made possible by spatial improvement centered on ‘playfulness’. Accordingly, it is necessary to plan a space for separate play learning by integrating underused classrooms in consideration of the decreasing number of students due to the recent change to the low birth rate era. Third, as upper grade students become more sociable and athletic, communication-oriented group learning was made possible by spatial improvement centered around the ‘autonomy’. In addition, the upper classrooms require floor heating to facilitate indoor activities; this is especially important considering problems of fine dust and other outdoor climate concerns. Fourth, it is necessary to plan a space for students’ emotional stability by reflecting the characteristics of ‘comfort’ in both the lower and upper grade classrooms. Accordingly, it is necessary to apply eco-friendly materials and nature-friendly designs to form a comfortable atmosphere like a house or natural environment. Also, it is necessary to use lighting effectively, according to the function ‘learning, living, resting, and playing’ in the classroom. Accordingly, LED lighting can be used to focus on learning, and pendants and indirect lighting can also be utilized to form various atmospheres during rest and play activities. In this way, if the curriculum is revised to better capture social changes within the educational space, including in consideration of the differences by grade, schools will become places of enjoyment, education and effective learning.">
